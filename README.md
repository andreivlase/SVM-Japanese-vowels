# SVM-Japanese-vowels

This project applies a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel to classify Japanese vowel utterances (/ae/) based on Linear Prediction Coefficients (LPC) extracted from audio recordings.
This project successfully demonstrates the use of SVM with RBF kernel on a time-series classification task involving LPC coefficients. Despite class imbalance, the model shows strong generalization on the two dominant classes with an overall high accuracy.
